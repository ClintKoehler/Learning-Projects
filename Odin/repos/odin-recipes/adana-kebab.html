    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 lbs minced lamb (20% fat)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup yogurt</li>
    <li>1/3 cup chopped parsley</li>
    <li>4 tsp sumac</li>
    <li>4 tsp dried red chili flakes</li>
    <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
    <li>2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 tsp cumin powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tbsp grated ginger</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><h4>Garlic Yogurt Sauce</h4></p>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups yogurt</li>
    <li>1/3 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place all kebab ingredients in a food processor then pulse until it is well incorporated. 
    <li>Remove from the food processor and place in a large container, using your hands knead the meat until sticky in texture. Cover container with clingwrap then let it rest overnight in the refrigerator.</li> 
    <li>Moisten your hand with water and divide mixture into 6 to 8 equal parts. Using long flat skewers, mould a long and flat kebab on it, add grooves into the surface using your fingers.</li>
    <li>Light up a charcoal grill and once charcoals have white-grey ash around it you are ready to cook the kebabs. Place your kebabs on the grill and cook for a few minutes on each side until charred, do not overcook it so it wonâ€™t be dry. You can grill the capsicums on the side.
    <li>Prepare your kebabs by serving it on top of the flatbread so it absorbs the dripping juices, enjoy it with the grilled capsicum, Garlic Yogurt Sauce and Hummus.</li>
