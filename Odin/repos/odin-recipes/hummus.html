<h3>Description</h3>

    Authenitc, creamy dreamy home-made hummus just like your favorite abi or abla would make in Turkey.
<p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 can (15 oz.) chickpeas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup tahini</li>
    <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1/4 cup spring water</li>
    <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>2 pinches of sea salt</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil, to top</li>
    <li>Water</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Blend the tahini, lemon juice and water in a food processor or blender until it becomes creamy, fluffy and white (this is the secret). 
    <li>Add in the garlic and salt and blend some more.</li> 
    <li>Add in a handful of washed garbanzo beans and blend again until smooth. 
    Continue adding in garbanzos until you get a nice smooth hummus but not to many as to turn it into a more yellow garbanzo mash.</li>
    <li>Add water in small increments until it's perfect for you. 
    <strong>DO NOT</strong> try and put all ingredients in at once and blend or you will get the more yellowish garbanzo mash. 
    <b>THE SECRET</b> is <b>CREAMING</b> the tahini and lemon juice/water first.</li> 
    <li>Serve topped with EVOO, fresh cracked pepper, paprika, whatever you wish.</li>
</ol>
